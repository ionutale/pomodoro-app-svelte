agents.md: A Technical Specification of Pomofocus.io Agents and CapabilitiesSection 1: System OverviewIntroductionThis document provides a technical specification of the Pomofocus.io web application, modeled as a system of interconnected, stateful agents. Each agent encapsulates a distinct domain of functionality, such as time management, task handling, or user settings. This agent-based model is intended to provide an unambiguous and structured representation of the application's capabilities, states, and operational logic for technical integration, automation, and analysis. The system is designed around the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that uses a timer to break work into focused intervals separated by short breaks.1Global State ManagementThe behavior and capabilities of all agents within the Pomofocus system are governed by a set of global states. These states determine feature availability and the underlying architecture of the user session.Authentication Status: The primary global state is isAuthenticated: boolean. This state dictates whether a user is operating anonymously or as a logged-in user. The transition to an authenticated state fundamentally alters the application's architecture. For an anonymous user, the application functions as a self-contained, client-side instance with state likely persisted in local browser storage. For an authenticated user, the application transitions to a client-server model. This architectural shift is necessitated by features such as the Mobile Alarm, which requires a backend server to register a device and send push notifications, a capability that cannot be managed solely within the browser.1 Consequently, an authenticated session enables server-side data persistence for tasks, settings, and reports, facilitating cross-device synchronization.Subscription Tier: The second critical global state is subscriptionTier: ('free' | 'premium'). This state is only relevant when isAuthenticated is true and acts as the primary controller for feature flagging throughout the application. Access to advanced capabilities, such as third-party integrations, extended reporting, and unlimited templates, is contingent upon a 'premium' subscription status.1 The premium plan is available on a monthly or yearly auto-renewing subscription basis, with a 7-day free trial option.1Section 2: Agent: TimerAgentDescriptionThe TimerAgent is the central component of the Pomofocus application. It is responsible for managing all time-tracking states and executing the core logic of the Pomodoro Technique. It operates in distinct modes—Pomodoro, Short Break, and Long Break—and manages the transitions between them, either automatically or through user intervention.1State DefinitionThe internal state of the TimerAgent can be modeled as follows:currentMode: ('Pomodoro' | 'ShortBreak' | 'LongBreak'): Represents the active timer mode. The duration for each mode is configurable via the SettingsAgent.1timerStatus: ('running' | 'paused' | 'stopped'): Defines the operational status of the timer. 'stopped' is the initial state before a session begins or after it is reset.timeRemaining: number: The time left in the current session, measured in seconds. This value decrements when timerStatus is 'running'.pomodorosCompletedInCycle: number: A counter that tracks the number of completed 'Pomodoro' sessions. This counter is used by the system to determine when to trigger a 'LongBreak' mode, based on the 'Long Break interval' setting.1CapabilitiesThe TimerAgent exposes a set of capabilities that allow for direct control over the timer's operation. These actions form the primary user interaction loop with the application's core functionality.CapabilityParametersDescriptionPreconditionsstartTimer()NoneBegins or resumes the countdown. Sets timerStatus to 'running'.timerStatus must be 'paused' or 'stopped'.pauseTimer()NonePauses the countdown.

This includes creation, modification, prioritization, completion, and deletion. The agent provides the structural framework for users to list and organize the work they intend to accomplish during their focus sessions.1State DefinitiontaskList: Task: An ordered array of Task objects. The formal structure of the Task object is defined in the Appendix.activeTaskId: string | null: The unique identifier of the task currently selected for the active focus session. When a Pomodoro session is completed, the actualPomodoros count for this task is incremented.CapabilitiesThe TaskAgent supports a comprehensive set of actions for task management:addTask(name, estimatedPomodoros): Creates a new task object and adds it to the taskList. The estimatedPomodoros parameter represents the user's estimate of how many 25-minute focus sessions the task will require.1updateTask(taskId, { name, estimatedPomodoros }): Modifies the properties of an existing task identified by taskId.deleteTask(taskId): Permanently removes a task from the taskList.toggleTaskCompletion(taskId): Toggles the isComplete status of a specified task. This corresponds to checking or unchecking a task in the UI.1setActiveTask(taskId): Sets the activeTaskId state to the specified task's ID, linking subsequent timer activity to that task.incrementEstimate(taskId): Increases the estimatedPomodoros count for a task by one. This is accessible via the Ctrl + I keyboard shortcut.1decrementEstimate(taskId): Decreases the estimatedPomodoros count for a task by one. This is accessible via the Ctrl + D keyboard shortcut.1clearFinishedTasks(): Removes all tasks from the taskList where isComplete is true.1clearAllTasks(): Empties the entire taskList, regardless of task completion status.1saveAsTemplate(task): A premium capability that saves a task's properties as a reusable template. A maximum of three templates can be saved on the free plan.1The TaskAgent's behavior is significantly influenced by the state of the IntegrationAgent. In its default, "native" mode, it manages a simple task model. However, when a Todoist integration is active (a premium feature), the agent enters an "integrated" mode. In this mode, it acts as a synchronization layer. Tasks can be imported from Todoist, and their data model within Pomofocus is enriched with fields like notes and due dates, which are sourced directly from Todoist.1 The completion status (isComplete) is synchronized bidirectionally between the two applications. This dual-mode operation means that the source of truth for task data can shift from Pomofocus to an external service, and actions like updateTask may trigger API calls to Todoist, representing a critical dependency for any automated interaction.Section 4: Agent: SettingsAgentDescriptionThe SettingsAgent manages all user-configurable preferences. It serves as the single source of truth for parameters that control the behavior of the TimerAgent, the application's appearance, and notification systems. The high degree of customization offered is a core feature of the Pomofocus application.1State DefinitionThe agent's state is a complex configuration object that mirrors the structure of the application's settings panel. It can be modeled with the following nested properties:timerSettings:pomodoro: number (minutes)shortBreak: number (minutes)longBreak: number (minutes)autoStartBreaks: booleanautoStartPomodoros: booleanlongBreakInterval: number (number of Pomodoros)soundSettings:alarmSound: AlarmSound (enum, see Appendix)alarmVolume: number (range 0-100)alarmRepeat: numbertickingSound: TickingSound (enum, see Appendix)tickingVolume: number (range 0-100)themeSettings:colorTheme: string (hex color code or theme identifier)hourFormat: ('12h' | '24h')darkModeWhenRunning: booleannotificationSettings:reminder: boolean (for the last minute of a session)mobileAlarm: { enabled: boolean, deviceId: string | null, type: ('Pomodoro' | 'Breaks' | 'Both' | 'None') }integrationSettings:todoistConnected: boolean (Premium)webhookUrl: string | null (Premium)CapabilitiesupdateSetting(key, value): The primary capability for modifying any setting. The key parameter uses a dot-notation string (e.g., 'timerSettings.pomodoro') to target a specific value within the state object.Comprehensive Settings SpecificationThe following table provides a detailed specification for every user-configurable setting managed by the SettingsAgent.1Setting KeyDescriptionData TypeAccepted Values / RangeDefault ValueRequires PremiumtimerSettings.pomodoroDuration of the focus session.numberInteger (minutes)25NotimerSettings.shortBreakDuration of the short break.numberInteger (minutes)5NotimerSettings.longBreakDuration of the long break.numberInteger (minutes)15NotimerSettings.autoStartBreaksAutomatically start breaks after a Pomodoro.booleantrue / falsefalseNotimerSettings.autoStartPomodorosAutomatically start Pomodoros after a break.booleantrue / falsefalseNotimerSettings.longBreakIntervalNumber of Pomodoros before a long break.numberInteger4NosoundSettings.alarmSoundSound played at the end of a session.string (enum)'Kitchen', 'Bell', 'Bird', 'Digital', 'Wood''Bell'NosoundSettings.alarmVolumeVolume of the alarm sound.number0 - 10050NosoundSettings.alarmRepeatNumber of times the alarm repeats.numberInteger1NosoundSettings.tickingSoundBackground sound during sessions.string (enum)'None', 'Ticking Fast', 'Ticking Slow', 'White Noise', 'Brown Noise''None'NosoundSettings.tickingVolumeVolume of the ticking sound.number0 - 10050NothemeSettings.colorThemeMain color theme for the timer.stringPredefined theme identifiers'default'NothemeSettings.hourFormatTime display format.string'12h', '24h''24h'NothemeSettings.darkModeWhenRunningEnable dark mode when the timer is active.booleantrue / falsefalseNonotificationSettings.reminderNotify during the last minute of a session.booleantrue / falsefalseNonotificationSettings.mobileAlarm.enabledEnable push notifications to a mobile device.booleantrue / falsefalseNo (Requires Account)integrationSettings.todoistConnectedStatus of Todoist integration.booleantrue / falsefalseYesintegrationSettings.webhookUrlWebhook endpoint URL.stringValid URLnullYesSection 5: Agent: ReportAgentDescriptionThe ReportAgent is responsible for aggregating, processing, and presenting user productivity data. It provides visualizations of focus time and offers data export functionalities, allowing users to analyze their work patterns over various timeframes.1State DefinitioncurrentReportView: { dateRange: { from: Date, to: Date }, grouping: ('daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'yearly') }: Defines the parameters for the currently displayed report. The 'yearly' grouping is a premium feature.1reportData: any: The structured dataset corresponding to the currentReportView parameters, used to render visual charts and summaries.CapabilitiesgenerateReport(dateRange, grouping): Fetches and processes focus history data based on the specified date range and grouping level. This capability populates the reportData state.downloadReport(format, { columns, delimiter }): Exports the user's focus history to a file. This is a premium-only capability.format: The file format, currently supporting 'CSV'.1columns: An array of strings specifying which data fields to include (e.g., 'Include Task', 'Focus Time').1delimiter: The character used to separate values in the CSV file, with options for 'Tab' or 'Comma'.1The ReportAgent clearly illustrates the application's freemium business model. The standard reporting features—daily, weekly, and monthly summaries—are designed for personal productivity tracking and are available to all users.1 These features provide intrinsic value by helping users reflect on their focus habits. The premium features, however, are oriented towards professional use cases. Yearly reports allow for long-term analysis, while the highly configurable CSV export functionality transforms Pomofocus from a simple timer into a data source for external systems. The ability to export raw data is intended for integration into larger professional workflows, such as generating client invoices, populating project management dashboards, or performing in-depth data analysis in spreadsheet software. This positions the premium version of the application as a tool for users who need to justify or analyze their time in a professional context.1Section 6: Agent: UserAgentDescriptionThe UserAgent manages user identity, authentication status, and subscription details. It serves as the gatekeeper for all authenticated features and handles the lifecycle of a user's account, from creation to deletion.1State DefinitionauthenticationStatus: ('authenticated' | 'anonymous'): The current authentication state of the session.userEmail: string | null: The email address associated with the authenticated user's account.subscription: { tier: ('free' | 'premium'), nextBillingDate: Date | null, autoRenews: boolean }: An object containing details of the user's subscription plan.1Capabilitieslogin(email, password): Authenticates a user and transitions the authenticationStatus to 'authenticated'.logout(): De-authenticates the user and reverts the authenticationStatus to 'anonymous'.getAccountDetails(): Retrieves the current user's email and subscription information from the server.1updateEmail(newEmail): Changes the email address associated with the account.1cancelSubscription(): Cancels the auto-renewal for a premium subscription.1deleteAccount(): A destructive and irreversible action that permanently deletes the user's account and all associated data after user confirmation.1Section 7: Agent: IntegrationAgentDescriptionThe IntegrationAgent is a premium-only agent that manages data exchange and interoperability with third-party services. It transforms Pomofocus from a standalone application into a component that can be embedded within a user's broader digital ecosystem.1State Definitiontodoist: { isConnected: boolean, syncStatus: ('syncing' | 'idle' | 'error'), config: {... } }: Manages the state of the Todoist integration, including connection status and synchronization activity.1webhook: { isEnabled: boolean, endpointUrl: string, events: ('start' | 'pause' | 'finish') }: Manages the state of the Webhook integration. events specifies which TimerAgent events will trigger a data payload to be sent to the endpointUrl.1CapabilitiesconnectTodoist(apiToken): Establishes an authenticated connection to a user's Todoist account.importTodoistTasks(): Fetches tasks from the connected Todoist account and populates the TaskAgent's taskList. It can parse estimated Pomodoros from the task title and import task descriptions as notes.1syncTodoistState(task): Pushes or pulls state changes, primarily task completion status, between Pomofocus and Todoist.1configureWebhook(url, events): Sets up a webhook by providing an endpoint URL and selecting the timer events (start, pause, finish) that should be transmitted. This allows for real-time integration with services like Zapier, Make, or IFTTT to automate workflows, such as updating a status in a messaging app or logging time in another tool.1This agent represents the most advanced functionality of the application. While the ReportAgent enables batch data export, the IntegrationAgent facilitates real-time, event-driven data flow. The Webhook capability sends data out of Pomofocus as actions occur, enabling immediate responses in other systems. The Todoist integration provides two-way synchronization, bringing data in and pushing updates back out. This level of interoperability allows Pomofocus to become an active participant in complex workflows, solidifying its value proposition for power users and professionals who rely on interconnected toolchains.Section 8: Appendix: Data Models and EnumerationsTask Object ModelThe Task object is the primary data structure managed by the TaskAgent.
